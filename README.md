# Foreword
In order to work, this application queries an API. This API is built in the form of Azure Functions with a Node.js runtime.

To find how to deploy the API locally, head over to my [nodejs-az-functions-api Github repo](https://github.com/mariusconjeaud/nodejs-az-functions-api).

# Build the app
Once the API is up and running - you need to execute the front-end app.

# Run the app
To run the app, execute the following command - this will open a new tab on your default browser with url *localhost:4200*

```bash
ng serve -o
```
